# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 30, 2020
##### HTML and CSS

**Today's Progress:** Finished Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** Although I have been working in FreeCodeCamp for almost 10 days, I officially launched my 100 days today.  Starting to get hang of how CSS and HTML work.  Figured out how to do the CSS for a:hover for a class -- that was exciting.  Really need to figure out Git and GitHub, as well as CodePen and how they interact. It's quite difficult thosto find info on how to use the features.

### Day 2: July 1, 2020
##### Git, Github, Visual Studio Code, Some CSS

**Today's Progress**: Watched several videos on Git and Github, and one on VSC.  Tried to set up Git on Mac. 

**Thoughts:** Trying to wrap head around how Git, Github, VSC, CodePen etc. work together. The info that's available online is inscrutable and usually assumes some prior knowledge.  Spent way too much time on this -- my head is spinning. Will leave for later. Did a little CSS.

### Day 3: July 2, 2020

### Day 4: July 3, 2020
##### CSS Animation, Survey form started

**Today's Progress:**
Tried to code some graphics and animation on my own by looking at examples on Codepen. That didn't work too well, so I went back to Freecodecamp to follow the instructions and encountered some difficulty with that as well.  So, I stopped banging my head against the animation wall and started the next css project, the survey form, after finishing the tribute page project in Freecodecamp. Making some progress.
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
It's been a long day.

### Day 5: July 5, 2020
##### Survey form continued

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing to work on the survey form.  
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
I am deliberately taking longer to create the survey because I don't want to just throw in the HTML and CSS and move on the next project. I'm trying to understand a couple of things: how to work on the project - does one start in HTML and then flush out the CSS, or is by section?  Plus, I need to play around with the elements to see what they do, organize the page, abstract the flow, etc. Slowly getting there.

### Day 6: July 6, 2020 - 55th birthday
##### CSurvey form continued

**Today's Progress:**
Survey form still in development - worked on background and added slider.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
 Did a lot of googling and looking at other codepens to figure our how to do certain things... and that's okay. Actually, I think its a way of getting ahead.

### Day 7: July 7, 2020 
##### Reviewed CSS descendents, inheritance, specificity. Started JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**
Reviewed CSS descendents, inheritance, specificity by watching 28 Net Ninja CSS beginner videos.  Learned about child selectors.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
 It was very useful to review and do. Things started to become a bit clearer in terms of inheritance, descendants, specificity, etc. Hopefully this will solve some of the problems in my survey.

### Day 8: July 8, 2020 
##### JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**
Watched 14 Net Ninja videos on JavaScript - covered variables, mathemetical operators, booleans, if, else, comparison operators
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
Made sense, didn't seem that bad, but I wasn't applying it.  I did perform the same functions in VS Code as he did in the video and had to figure out why it didn't work several times -- had to delete stuff from Chrome, etc.  I really like the way Net Ninja presents and explains.

### Day 9: July 9, 2020 
##### JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**
Watched more Net Ninja videos on JavaScript - covered logical operators, while loops, for loops, and started functions
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
Was a slow kinda day. Didn't feel like I covered a lot, but still made a wee bit of progress.  I surived to code another day.

### Day 10: July 10, 2020 
##### JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**
Worked through 45 FreeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
Really useful to do the challenge in Freecodecamp and then to run it in the chrom dev console -- the error messages there were somehow more focused and useful in helping me target where the problem was...

<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
Continued to challenge in Freecodecamp and then to run it in the chrom dev console --

### Day 12: July 12, 2020 
##### JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**
Worked through 7 FreeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
Continued to challenge in Freecodecamp and then to run it in the chrom dev console -- Couple minor things that are slowing me down are typos, missing brackets at end of if else; and most importantly, not slowing down to read the entire problem all the way through and think about it.  Saw this quote on a Quora response in the Quora code space:  “Programming is thinking not typing.”  And am starting to realize that how I think and approach problems needs to evolve.

### Day 13: July 13, 2020 
##### JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**
Watched Net Ninja JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners - Episodes #21 - #27
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
Really think the Net Ninja series - digestible bits, great examples, and get to hear the vernacular. Other than that, not much progress. Today was a yucky day.

### Day 14: July 14, 2020 
##### JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**
Worked through 14 FreeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts:** 
Completed 14 FreeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges & w/in striking distance of finishing basic JS. But am uncomfortable w/ competency level & need to supplement w/ examples & practice from other resources before finishing & moving on to the next series of FreeCodeCamp challenges, ES6.
