# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 30, 2020
##### HTML and CSS

**Today's Progress**: Finished Tribute page project. 

**Thoughts:** Although I have been working in FreeCodeCamp for almost 10 days, I officially launched my 100 days today.  Starting to get hang of how CSS and HTML work.  Figured out how to do the CSS for a:hover for a class -- that was exciting.  Really need to figure out Git and GitHub, as well as CodePen and how they interact. It's quite difficult thosto find info on how to use the features.
