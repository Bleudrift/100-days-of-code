# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 30, 2020
##### HTML and CSS

**Today's Progress:** Finished Tribute Page. 

**Thoughts:** Although I have been working in FreeCodeCamp for almost 10 days, I officially launched my 100 days today.  Starting to get hang of how CSS and HTML work.  Figured out how to do the CSS for a:hover for a class -- that was exciting.  Really need to figure out Git and GitHub, as well as CodePen and how they interact. It's quite difficult thosto find info on how to use the features.

### Day 2: July 1, 2020
##### Git, Github, Visual Studio Code, Some CSS

**Today's Progress**: Watched several videos on Git and Github, and one on VSC.  Tried to set up Git on Mac. 

**Thoughts:** Trying to wrap head around how Git, Github, VSC, CodePen etc. work together. The info that's available online is inscrutable and usually assumes some prior knowledge.  Spent way too much time on this -- my head is spinning. Will leave for later. Did a little CSS.

### Day 4: July 3, 2020
##### CSS Animation, Survey form started

**Today's Progress:**
Tried to code some graphics and animation on my own by looking at examples on Codepen. That didn't work too well, so I went back to Freecodecamp to follow the instructions and encountered some difficulty with that as well.  So, I stopped banging my head against the animation wall and startned the next css project after the tribute in Freecodecamp, the survey form. Making some progress.

**Thoughts:** 
It's been a long day.
